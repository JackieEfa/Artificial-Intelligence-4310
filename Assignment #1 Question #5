(defun getpositions(element ls) ;; define function with elements in a list
 (let ((final nil))
;;evalates each element that is not empty kinda a like a while loop
 (dotimes (i (length ls))
;;like a do loop with element{i} in list until there are no more elements left to evaluate.
   (if (equal(nth i ls) element)
;;nth locates the element within a list, car will find the first elemnt in the list that matches
       (push (+ i 1) final)))
;;like the pushback and add the element to the diisplay output and will display all the elements that pass the condition, or nil.
(reverse final)))
;;the original wirte sequence would be 7 5 2 because the push just make room for a element by pushing back the previous one. 
  
;; writing out the function output, number to look for and the list of numbers in the list.
(print " The positions of n are: ")
;; tr print out a list you need to use write instead or print or else it wont work.
(write (getpositions '2 '(1 2 3 4 2 5 2 6)))
