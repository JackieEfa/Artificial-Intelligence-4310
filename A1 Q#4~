(defun factorial (x)
  (cond ;; cond is equal to if else statements just diffrent formatting than c++
   ;; need to write equations with expression first
   ;; ie 1 + 2 is + 1 2
    ((= x 1) 1) ;; 1 is equal to if true 
    ((= x 0) 1)
    ;; t stands for the truth condition 
    ;; when x meets the requirments then the truthstatement will work
    ;; however for this program if x is a negative number then the program will abort.
    (t (* x (factorial (- x 1)))))
)

(print  "The Facotrial is:") ;; simple print statement
(print (fatorial 7))
;; prints function
