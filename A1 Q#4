(defun factorial (n);; defines function with one variable in it. 
  (cond 
   ;; cond is equal to if else statements just diffrent formatting than c++
   ;; need to write equations with expression first
   ;; ie 1 + 2 is + 1 2
    ((= n 1) 1) ;; 1 is equal to if true 
    ((= n 0) 1)
    (t ;; t stands for the truth condition 
	(* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
	 ;; when n meets the requirments then the truth statement will work
   	 ;; however for this program if n is a negative number then the program will abort.
)

(print  "The Facotrial is:") ;; simple print statement
(print (factorial 7))
;; prints function with the n variable ite evaluating
